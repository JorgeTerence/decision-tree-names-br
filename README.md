Special thanks to my professors, [@Thiago Inocêncio](https://github.com/ThiagoInocencio) and [@Carlos Veríssimo](https://github.com/ProfVerissimoFatec) for nurturing my interest in discovering new ways to bang my head against a computer screen. And for the patience to answer my never ending questions.
